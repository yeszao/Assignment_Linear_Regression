# Assignment of Multiple Linear Regression Model
This is a simple Multiple Linear Regression Model using both and **statsmodel** and **sklearn**.

# File explanation
- `Course3_Assignment_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter file can run directly 
- `Linear+Regression+Subjective+Questions.pdf`: The answer of the subjective questions

# How does it works?
1. Import dataset with `pandas`
2. EDA
3. Divide dataset to training data and test data
4. Remove variables with `RFE`
5. Train data and drop variables by `p-value` and `VIF`
6. Evaluate model with R squared and residual
